                <h5 class="card-title">Salar Jung Museum, Hyderabad, Telangana</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Topping the roster of museums in Hyderabad – once the capital of India's richest princely state – is the vast Salar Jung Museum in the old city, displaying a collection amassed by Mir Yousuf Ali Khan (Salar Jung III), grand vizier to the seventh Nizam.</p>
                <br>
                <p>During his tenure, the trinket-loving courtier accumulated enough royal heirlooms to fill 39 galleries, covering everything from jade mouthpieces for hookah pipes and engraved talwar swords to European sculptures and exquisite paintings from all the Indian miniature schools.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The museum layout is rather confusing and it’s easy to miss whole sections of the collection, so take your time and look out for quirky pieces like the elegantly carved Veiled Rebecca by 19th-century Italian sculptor Benzoni, and the side rooms with extravagant Persian carpets and Chinese and Japanese celadon, porcelain and lacquerware.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Detour: You can see more of the treasures of the Nizams and their courtiers in the delightful, European-influenced Chowmahalla Palace, a short walk away from the Salar Jung Museum through the old city’s atmospheric bazaars, on the far side of the Charminar. Also make time to visit the sometimes overlooked Nizam’s Museum, containing the vast walk-through wardrobe of the sixth Nizam, and the rambling State Museum, constructed by the seventh Nizam as a playhouse for his daughter.</p>
